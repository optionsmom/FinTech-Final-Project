## Introduction

Team Goat Fintech has decided the create REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) by using blockchain technology.  We will be creating a token by which interested investors can use as an investment vehicle to ascertain value, share expenses, distribute cash flow, and by which the investing guidelines and laws are held.

Our REIT will be tokensized by using an apartment complex as use case whereupon the framework could be expanded upon to other real estate assets effectively and effciently.
